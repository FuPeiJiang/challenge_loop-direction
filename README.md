# Challenge #1
conditionally control **loop direction** depending on the variable `reverse`.
# Challenge #2
challenge 1 + you have to conditionally do `sum += sum + 77777777` **before or after** the loop depending on `reverse`
# Rules
1. Be faster than `'repeat yourself'`
2. Do not repeat the inner loop: `sum = arr[i] - sum`
3. Do not repeat the conditionally beforeOrAfter code: `sum += sum + 77777777`

...<br>
you must use both `sum = arr[i] - sum` and `sum += sum + 77777777` once and ONLY once.
